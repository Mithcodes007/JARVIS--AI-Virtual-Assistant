# JARVIS--AI-Virtual-Assistant
JARVIS is a Python-based AI virtual assistant designed to interact with users through voice commands. 
It uses speech recognition to take user inputs and performs tasks such as searching the web, opening applications, telling the date and time, playing music, and more. 
The assistant responds using text-to-speech and integrates APIs like OpenAI for answering queries conversationally. 
I implemented this project as a hands-on application of Python modules and automation techniques, enhancing my understanding of voice-controlled systems and API integration.
